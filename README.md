# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

(I'm sorry, my self-study plan is under development..)

### Part 1

1) Data Structures 
    * List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary, DataFrame
    * filter(lambda()), map(lambda()), reduce(), range()
    * Matrix, Vector, Stack, Queue, Tree 
2) Sorting Algorithms
    * Bubble sort
    * Insertion sort
    * Merge sort
    * Shell sort
    * Selection sort
3) Searching Algorithms
    * Linear search
    * Binary search
    * Interpolation search
4) Graph
    * Graph travel
    * BFS (breadth-first search)
    * DFS (depth-first search)
    * Cycle detection, Minimum Spanning Tree, Topological sorting and etc.

### Part 2 

(it's plannig only)

1) Unsupervised learning algorithms 
    * Clustering algorithms 
    * Dimensionality reduction
    * Association rules mining 
    * Anomaly detection algorithms

2) Supervised learning algorithms 
    * Linear regression
    * Logistic regression
    * K-nearest neighbor algorithm
    * Decision trees
    * Naive Bayes
    * Linear discriminant analysis 
    * Similarity learning

3) NN 

4) NLP (RNN, natural language toolkit )
